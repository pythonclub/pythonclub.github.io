        Pelican is a static site generator, written in Python_.
        
        * Write your weblog entries directly with your editor of choice (vim!)
          in reStructuredText_ or Markdown_
        * Includes a simple CLI tool to (re)generate the weblog
        * Easy to interface with DVCSes and web hooks
        * Completely static output is easy to host anywhere
        
        Features
        --------
        
        Pelican currently supports:
        
        * Blog articles and pages
        * Comments, via an external service (Disqus). (Please note that while
          useful, Disqus is an external service, and thus the comment data will be
          somewhat outside of your control and potentially subject to data loss.)
        * Theming support (themes are created using Jinja2_ templates)
        * PDF generation of the articles/pages (optional)
        * Publication of articles in multiple languages
        * Atom/RSS feeds
        * Code syntax highlighting
        * Import from WordPress, Dotclear, or RSS feeds
        * Integration with external tools: Twitter, Google Analytics, etc. (optional)

        Why the name "Pelican"?
        -----------------------
        
        "Pelican" is an anagram for *calepin*, which means "notebook" in French. ;)

        ================

        * Add ``gzip_cache`` plugin to compress common text files into a ``.gz``

        * Add support for AsciiDoc-formatted content
        * Add ``USE_FOLDER_AS_CATEGORY`` setting so that feature can be toggled on/off
        * Support arbitrary Jinja template files
        * Restore basic functional tests
