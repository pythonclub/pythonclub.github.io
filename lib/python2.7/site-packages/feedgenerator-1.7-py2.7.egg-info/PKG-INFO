Description: feedgenerator-py3k
        ==================
        
        Feedgenerator-py3k is a standalone version of Django's feedgenerator.
        It is based on the current Django Version 1.5.dev20120824122350.
        
        The previous feedgenerator 1.2.1 is based on rather old code, and
        during the port to Python 3 it became obvious that (at least) the handling
        of unicode strings has to be refactored.
        
        Django has evolved since, so I decided to create a new standalone version
        which is based upon modern code.
